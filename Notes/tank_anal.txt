Analog Tank Controls
*4 channel input
**4ma to 20ma
Scaled to PID, so in SCP, input min is 0 and input max is 16383
Level sensors will usually have the option to calibrate to a percent. Because of this, SCP out can be and Interger
instead of a float

Use LES and GRT to compare level in N7:0. Then use TON for 10 seconds above or below level. 

Use a Bit or Integer as a boolean for fill

Link TON to a condition DN for fill and drain. Fill = 1 drain = 0. If timer for fill is up, energize boolean. Branch around
t4:0/dn with an XIC that is the same bit as boolean. This works as a latch for fill. In front of this XIC, put a XIO that
links to the timer for the drain. That way if the drain is open, pump won't start to fill tank. 

Use boolean to get state. if one, energize bit that turns pump on. If 0, open valve
