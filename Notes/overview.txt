Overview
*Steps TO Open Project
1)open RSLinx, RSLogix and Emulate
2)Add drivers to RSLinx
	*ethernet/ip and emulate
	*in emulate, click rs family
3)In RSLogix, create new file and verify
4)Run emulator

Functionality
*Starts with ladder 2. Default ladder
*DOn't want all code in ladder
*Each line is called a rung. Program ends with blank rung
*Rungs also refered to as subroutine
*Can jump between subroutines
*Progams run from top to bottom. Can jum bewteen sub-routines
*Each time progams runs is called scans
*Scan times are timed in milliseconds
*Find scan times under Processor Status tab
	*Under scan time, tells how long to scan in milliseconds
*PLCs are very stable
