This is the physical components. Should have a startup map that explains start
-up cycles. 
Hand off/auto(HOA control)
	Used for digital and discrete devices. Hand blower could energize on
button press, or only run when held down. three inputs, one for hand, one for
off and one for auto. 

Project 004
	in digital io, associate inputs with bits in data file. DOnt refer to
inputs and outputs directly. One shot for button presses so a single button pres
only runs instruction one time

**steps
	*create file for digital io
	*create an input for each condition, off hand and auto with I:0/x, then
on same rung OTE a different bit for each with B3:0/x
	*then create an XIC for blower at different bit than the previous 3 
conditons, and on same run create an output at O:2/0 which is module or channel
2.
	*create file for controls
	*map three rungs with XIC commands from digital IO file, and place a 
ONS after each to prevent multiple scans while button being pressed.
	*create N7 MOV condition on each rung for inputs, and use 0 for off
1 for hand and 2 for auto.
	*on rung one with HAND XIC, place NEQ with source b as 2 to confirm that
the process is not already running in hand
	*These MOV statements should be mapped to integer called BLOWER_STATE
	*On new rung in controls, check if integer is equal to 1 or 2 then 
energize bit corresponding with blower bit, which is the same as the XIC in 
digital IO before blower output. Blower output is O:2/0
