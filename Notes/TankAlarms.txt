Tank Alarm System
	Water tank with pump to fill, and valve to drain. Analog input Level 
sensor to cycle pump and valve. HH and LL alarms. 
Modules:
	*8-input 10/30 VDC
	*8-output Relay
	*Analog 2 Chan input, 2 Chan output. Scaled to PID
Three Files: Alarms, Io, Controls

IO
1.Assign valve to bit and output on first rung
2.Assign pump to bit and output on second rung
3.Analog input SCP on third rung for level sensor. Assign output to N7:0

Controls
1.Output from SCP input compared with GRT and LES to control level. 
2.Use TON to measure 10 seconds above or below level
3.Use timer DN for pump(LES) to set a bit to one. Lock open with rung loop
  and put XIO for timer on the valve in front
4.Use boolean bit from above to energize pump and valve. Bit HH and LL alarm 
  XIO in front

Alarms
1. Compare integer from SCB output with GRT and LES for HH and LL alarms
2. TON after comparisons with rungs around timer. In Rung, XIC the timer dn
    bit to keep energized, and OSR after.
3.Create new rung for each (HH and LL). XIC from timer DN with rung around. In 
  rung around, use output bit of that rung to keep close, with another level
  compariosn of N7:0 in front. This comparison will keep this alarm on until 
  above or below certain level. 
4. Create another rung for each HH and LL with XIC of the OSR output bits. 
   This rung will output to another bit that will be the notify bit
5. Loop around input condition(which is the OSR output) with an XIC for notify
   bit and an XIO to a bit tied to an alarm acknowledge switch
