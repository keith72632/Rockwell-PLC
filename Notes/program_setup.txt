Program Setup
*Create ne project and rename ladder two to main
*configure plc by clicking on configure tab.
*in cofigure tab, configure the frist device
***then add analog 4 channel input
	*change input range to 4-20ma
	*change data format
	*raw is converted into range of 4000- 20000 which is 14 bit signal
	*scale for PID range is 0 to 16483
*Look through the list of devices supported and configure

Scaling and Resoltuion
**scale
2-bit 2^2 4 levels
4-bit 2^4 16 levels
6-bit 2^6 64 levels
8-bit 2^8 256 levels
10-bit 2^10 1024 levels
12-bit 2^12 4096 levels
14-bit 2^14 16384
16-bit 2^16 65536
32-bit 2^32 4.2 billion levels
64-bit 2^64 18.4 quintillion levels

*Resoltuion is essentially how many values can be extracted out of certain range
*100 == 3 levels. 100.00 = 5 levels
*When 4-20ma is converted to 4000 - 20000(which is 16000), needs atleast 16,000
levels of resolution. WHich is 14 bit. 

Function files
*data files hold memory, program files hold ladder logic
*function files are specific to each product
*HSC high speed counter. COnfigured to recieve and count high frequency inputs
*STI Selectable timed interrupt. allows user to designate one of the program files as being scanned more often or called out of sequence. basically an interrupt.
*RTC real time clock. Older plc need a RTC module added, but new versions have it built in

Program Files
*Starts at ladder two. Rename to main. Entry point
*Right click on profile files and click add new. Then select number
*Name program something intuitive, like alarms, IO or controls
