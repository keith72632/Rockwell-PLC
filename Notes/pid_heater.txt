Heater Digital
    Two switches. High temp and low temp. Assingn each input a bit. One output, which will be heater on. Assign it a bit
as well. Use low temp assigned bit to enegerize heater. Create a ciruit around this instrucution with the energized heater
bit as a condition, to keep it running after it hits the low level. Use an XIO in condition loop that is linked to the 
high level sensor to shut heater off.

Heater Analog
    4 channel analog input and output. Configure channel to 4 to 20 and PID. SCP input channel. input min and max 0-16383.
Output n7:0. Next configure PID. Create a PID file. Assign Process control, which in the output from previous SPC. Assign 
control variable to integer N7:1. Set input output and time mode. Time mode == TIMED. Set scaled set point to temp wanted to
maintain. Setpoint min and max 0 to 212. In output, control output is only used if in manual. output max and min are 
percentages and should be set to 0 and 100%

PID Setup screen
    Time Mode = STI and Timed
    Scaled Set Points = Point to maintain (ex. temp)
    Setpoint max = High Point reached (ex. high temp)
    Setpoint Min = Low point reacged (ex. Low temp)
    Out put min and max are percentage = 0 to 100% of range

Alarms and Notifications
	Alarms should have a delay on them. The delay should then have a rung around it and latch it open using its DN bit and
a OSR. This will keep the alarm on even after it drops below the alarm level. On another rung, XIC the DN bit from the timer and
energize a bit. Use that bit to latch the DN. Create another branch for Alarm resets. Alarm resets should be XIO for a button
